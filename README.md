# jqc

jqc is a really small script, **just one line**, that re-enables `$` in the jQuery compatibility mode.

### Note!

As of January 2021 this repo is archived and no changes will be made. Read more at https://klooven.link/archive.

## Why?

Sometimes the compatibily mode is activated (eg. in WordPress) even if you don't really need it. This script lets you use `$` instead of `jQuery` in this mode.

If possible, you should of course not use that mode if you don't need it.

## How?

jqc is made with the [jsDelivr CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) in mind.

Using jsDelivr you can combine files, so you can just combine jqc with any file you want!

[Here](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#combine-multiple-files)'s how to combine files.

## Extras

#### Compatibility mode?

#### WordPress
